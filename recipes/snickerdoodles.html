    <p>So easy to make and very good. A helpful tip for coating the cookies in the sugar/cinnamon mixture is to put the mixture in a ziplock baggie and then add the balls of dough. It is an easy mess free way to coat the cookies.</p>
    <p>This is an old fashion recipe, and they don't seem like anything too special, but people just go nuts for these!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 & 3/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar. Add eggs one at a time, mixing after each. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended.</li>
        <li>In a small shallow bowl, stir together the 2 tablespoons of sugar with the cinnamon. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls and roll the balls in the sugar mixture. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should be slightly golden at the edges. Remove to cool on wire racks.</li>
